# Malleable C2 Profiles

A Malleable C2 profile is a simple program that modifies the bahavior of the Cobalt Strike Beacon. 

This repository contains a set of Malleable C2 profiles aimed to help with the creation of your own. The best way to create a profile is to modify an existing one. Several example profiles are available in this repository.

You can find a reference profile with all the possible options available [here](https://github.com/Cobalt-Strike/Malleable-C2-Profiles/blob/master/normal/reference.profile).
